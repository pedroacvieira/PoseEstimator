# Pose Estimator

Test class for pose estimation between two RGBD images. Implemented as a sample code for testing computer vision applications with C++.

* Uses `opencv_contrib` mudule `rgbd`, which already contains functions for computing the pose between two RGBD frames (Docs: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d2/d3a/group__rgbd.html) (GitHub: https://github.com/tzutalin/OpenCV-RgbdOdometry).
* Depends on `OpenCV 3.4` and `Eigen 3.3.9`.
